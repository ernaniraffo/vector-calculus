# vector-calculus

A vector calculus library.

## Files

`vector.py` - contains the `Vector3D` class, a three dimensional vector class with built in arithmetic methods.

`dotProduct.py` - given a dimension and components of two vectors, `a` and `b`, computes their dot product.

`vectorLen.py` - given components of a vector `a`, computes its length and outputs in the format: `âˆšnum = length`.

`vectorTest.py` - testing file for the `Vector3D` class.
